    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I chose to attempt to classify the Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus into three categories: \"question\", \"answer\", and \"statement\". I manually aggregated dialogue acts into one of three categories, though some dialogue acts did not fit easily onto one, and as such were classifeid into \"other\" and were removed from further training/testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only features that I used for this classifier were the stemmed tokens from the utterance itself. Becuse utterances were short, I chose not to use parts-of-speech tagged tokens, as this would have made the resulting feature space much too sparse. Accuracy would likely be improved if additional features were included, such as the length of the utterance, its index in the transcript, and the characteristics of the speaker (education, sex, etc.), but I do not include these features here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the features are vectorized (using a basic bag-of-words model), the training and evaluation process follow that of the parts-of-speech tagger almost identically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final accuracy is about 93%, which seems fairly good. However, examining the confusion matrix, its clear from the confuion matrix that this is perhaps misleading–the vast majority of labels are under the \"statement\" category, so the accuracy is dominated by performance on this one category. Still, such a classifeir could prove useful for high-level classification of dialogue acts, and with some more tweaking (both of the categories and of the features) I see no reason why this cannot perform better. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am using a slightly different version of the Switchboard corpus code which works better with python 3. This code is stored on the github page linked below,\n",
