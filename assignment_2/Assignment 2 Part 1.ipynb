    "In this assignment, I use Keras to implement an artificial neural network for Parts of Speech (PoS) tagging and evaluate the result. I use data from the Penn treebank corpus in the NLTK library. I draw heavily from a tutorial at the following link, but make alterations to the code in the hopes of improving performance and better understanding the methodology. \n",

    "https://becominghuman.ai/part-of-speech-tagging-tutorial-with-the-keras-deep-learning-library-d7f93fa05537\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I use a standard **sequential Neural Network architecture**, rather than something fancy like a recurrent neural net. I feal that, for a first attempt at implementing a PoS tagger that this basic architecture is preferable. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seemed that the Schmitt paper only used the term itself and its suffix to determine the parts of speech. I used these features, but also considered many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The term itself\n",
    "- Number of terms in the sentence\n",
    "- Whether the term was the first in the sentence\n",
    "- Whether the term was the last in the sentence\n",
    "- Whether the term was capitalized (i.e.: bill vs. Bill)\n",
    "- Whether the word was all capitalized (i.e.: HELLO)\n",
    "- Whether the word all lowercase (i.e.: hello)\n",
    "- The 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-character prefix (if long enough) was available\n",
    "- The 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-character suffic (if long enough) was available\n",
    "- Whether the term was all alphanumeric (i.e.: had no puntuation)\n",
    "- The token before the term (if not the first term)\n",
    "- The token that appears after the term (if not the last term)\n",
    "- Whether the term has a hyphen (as in \"-\")\n",
    "- Whether the term has a period (e.g., U.S.A, Dr.)\n",
    "- Whether the term has an aporstrophe (e.g., \"Jane Smith's\")\n",
    "- whether the term was entirely numeric\n",
    "- Whether the term had any capitalization inside the text (e.g., PhD)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I have included way more features than those used in the Schmitt paper. I am hoping that these new features will mosly help in certain special cases which Schmitt originally didn't especially account for, such as apostrophes denoting proper nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "I experimneted with many different settings for the neural network classifier. The network I settled on had an input layer, an output layer, and a single hidden layer. I experimented with adding a second hidden layer, but didn't notice any increase in efficiency and so it wasn't worth the training slowdown. I used 512 nodes in the hidden layer; this is what the tutorial used and I didn't notice much difference using other values, and so I kept this as is. I was worried about overfitting, and so I set the \"dropout\" pretty high. Dropout is a technique where some portion of nodes are randomly ignored during each stage of trainingâ€”this helps distribute waeights to other nodes and makes the architecture less likely to overfit. Rather than sigmoud activation that was used in Schmitt's paper, I use relu activiation, mostly because this seems to be the most-oftenly used in the tutorials and descriptions I read through.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluation, I used standard accuracy, as this is what was used in the Schmitt paper and so allows my results to be comparable. \n",
    "\n",
    "My final result is an accuracy on the test set of about 96.3%, which is comparable to that in the Schmitt paper. I guess that this means that all of my extra features didn't really help much, and that really the term + suffix is the most important feature. "
